Every time exams roll around, something weird happens in my friend group. It’s not the usual panic or cramming. No, exams don’t trigger panic - they trigger projects!

One friend decides it’s the perfect time to build a new landing page every day. Another starts a blog about "staying focused" (written entirely instead of studying). Someone else builds a tool to rate their stupid financial decisions, like a Michelin guide but for bad financial decisions. Suddenly, everyone’s busy but no one’s touched a textbook. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing.

Me? I’m just here writing this post, which definitely feels productive.
Also I launched a [full stack app](https://id.neuland-ingolstadt.de/learn-more) that allows you generate and verify memmber cards for our club. Would I have done that during the semester without exams? Probably not.

It’s this strange collective energy, like we’re all in silent agreement that the best way to cope with looming deadlines is to make something completely unrelated. Honestly, I love it. I’ve never been more motivated to start things I won’t finish.

I wish it could always be exam season. My GitHub has never looked so alive.
